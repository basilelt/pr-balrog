Generate exactly ${numQuestions} multiple-choice questions to test the author's understanding.

Rules:
- Focus on WHY implementation choices were made, not just WHAT changed
- Test awareness of risks, trade-offs, and side-effects visible in the diff
- Each question has exactly 3 options labeled A, B, C
- ${multiNote}
- Never ask about trivial formatting or naming choices
- Explanations should be 1-2 sentences max
- ${langNote}
